                <p className="text-[black] leading-relaxed pt-[10px] pl-[20px]">Hello, my name is Ratchakorn Kanwai, and my nickname is Tee.<br/>I am 24 years old and currently studying at Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology,
                majoring in Information Technology in the Sunday program. Although I do not yet have direct experience in the IT field, 
                I have a background in technical work.<br/>  I chose to learn IT on my own and enrolled in an IT program to gain more knowledge and skills.<br/>  
                I hope to have the opportunity to join a company that welcomes individuals without prior experience, as I am eager to learn, adapt,<br/>  
                and contribute to the success of the organization. I also hope the project I created will assist in your consideration.</p>
